# Personalized Telecommunications Offers using K-Nearest Neighbors

## 🔄 Overview:
This project aims to classify a group of telecommunications customers into different segments based on their service usage patterns. Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, the model will predict the group membership of each customer to allow the telecommunications provider to create personalized offers for them. The data for this project is sourced from IBM and contains 1000 customer records.

## 🎊 Motivation:
The telecommunications industry is highly competitive and requires companies to constantly seek new ways to attract and retain customers. By using demographic data to predict customer group membership, the company can create customized offers, thereby improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## 🏁 Learning Objectives:
1)	Loading and cleaning a customer dataset
2)	Implementing KNN algorithm for classification
3)	Visualizing and analyzing data to gain insights
4)	Evaluating model performance and fine-tuning the parameters
5)	Deploying the model for practical use in creating personalized offers

## ⚙️ Technical Aspects:
The project involves pre-processing of data, feature extraction, normalization, and training and testing of the KNN model. The project also covers data visualization and analysis, evaluation of model performance, and deployment. The technology used includes Python libraries such as Piplite, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Scipy.

## 🧰 Technology used:
